# thi.ng/dstruct

This library provides the following data structures in a Clojure/Clojurescript compatible way:

- Heap
- Interval tree
- Unionfind (connected components, undirected graph)

Furthermore, a number of general purpose helper functions for
indexing, sequencing etc. is included.

This library is the result of a thi.ng projectwide
restructuring / dissolving of the [thi.ng/common](http://thi.ng/common) library.

*Note:* This library relies on the new conditional reader syntax of
 recent Clojure & Clojurescript versions and therefore is **not
 compatible with Clojure versions < 1.7.0**

Please see [index.org](src/index.org) for further information.
